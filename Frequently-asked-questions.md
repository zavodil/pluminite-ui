## What is Pluminite?

Pluminite is a NFT marketplace that allows you to mint your creations on the NEAR blockchain, with no upfront cost for your first 3 mints if you don’t already have a fully funded NEAR account.

### What does “minting” mean?

 It means you published your work on a blockchain.In this case, on the NEAR blockchain.

### How can you offer minting with “no upfront costs” to people without a funded NEAR account?
Pluminite is using a unique NEAR feature called “Guest Accounts” that allow us to supply a small amount of NEAR to an account. In exchange the first sale anyone makes who has used this feature will deduct the cost of their minting and wallet funding from their first sale.

Pluminite also takes a 5% cut of all sales so that we can continue to enable other artists to mint without any upfront costs.

### What if I want to fund my guest account by purchasing $NEAR?
At this time, by signing up through Pluminite, you cannot fund that account in any way except selling your NFT’s. We hope to have a better answer in the future.
Is minting my NFT on Pluminite bad for the planet?
Because Pluminite is built on NEAR, which is a carbon neutral Proof of Stake blockchain network, the cost of minting 1 NFT is roughly equivalent to running your laptop for about 2 minutes. You can read more about NEAR’s carbon neutrality here. https://near.org/blog/the-near-blockchain-is-climate-neutral/
